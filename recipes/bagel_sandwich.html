        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This bagel sandwich is a delicious recipe I created using only a bagel, cream cheese and eggs! I always try
            to eat something like this every Sunday.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One bagel</li>
            <li>Cream Cheese (preferably Philadelphia)</li>
            <li>Two eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the bagel into two sides, and toast the bagel.</li>
            <li>While the bagel is toasting, start up the stove.</li>
            <li>After putting oil to your pan, crack two eggs and put it into the pan, and let it cook.</li>
            <li>Once the bagel is done toasting, spread cream cheese on both sides of the bagel.</li>
            <li>Flip the eggs until they seem well cooked.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the egg in between the two sides of the bagel.</li>
            <li>Voila! You're done, now enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
